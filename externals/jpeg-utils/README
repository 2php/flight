FROM: https://svn.csail.mit.edu/rrg_pods/jpeg-utils/

Name:         jpeg-utils
Maintainers:  Albert Huang <albert@csail.mit.edu>
Summary:      Wrapper functions around libjpeg to simplify JPEG compression and
              decompression with in-memory buffers.
Description:  
  note: This is a simple enough library that you could just copy the .c
  and .h files in to your own programs.

  To use the library, link against -ljpeg-utils, or use 
  pkg-config --cflags --libs jpeg-utils

Requirements:
  libjpeg62

  For faster performance, install libjpeg-turbo, an SSE-accelerated
  library that is ABI compatible with libjpeg62.
