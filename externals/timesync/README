The script timesync-as-root works by sshing into localhost as root.
You can make this passwordless by setting up public key authentication for the root account (this is probably bad general security practice)


timesync was ported over from Agile: agile/software/src/timesync

== original documentation (Agile) ==

timesync handles time synchronization of the blade servers.

A startup script (/etc/init.d/dgc-timesync) is installed to each blade and run
on system startup.  This script spawns the timesync daemon, which should always
be running on every machine.
